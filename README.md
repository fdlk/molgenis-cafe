# molgenis-cafe
Hackathon result: let MOLGENIS be queried by Cafe Variome

## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties

## Remarks on the swagger
### unify
The [current implementation](api.yaml) needs to be unified with
[the specification](https://github.com/vl62/uol-open_discovery_specification/blob/master/specification.yaml)
because they say different things.

### patternProperties
The metadata response uses patternProperties. Those are 
[not supported by Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/744).

### code generator
The logic tree has a structure that I can only model using a oneOf,
but the java code generator cannot handle this.
